📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice and implementations.
I am learning DSA step by step and solving problems to improve my problem-solving skills, logic, and coding efficiency.
🚀 What’s Inside
Basic to advanced DSA concepts
Problem solutions with clean and simple code
Focus on logic building and optimization
Language used: C++ (and may add more later)
🧠 Topics Covered (Updating Regularly)
Arrays
Strings
Searching & Sorting
Recursion
Mathematics & Logic Problems
(More coming soon...)
🎯 Goal
Strengthen core DSA fundamentals
Prepare for coding contests and interviews
Maintain consistency and track my progress publicly
📌 Note
This repository is a learning journey, so solutions may improve over time.
Suggestions and improvements are always welcome!

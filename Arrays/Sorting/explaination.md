This program checks whether a given number X 
exists in an array or not. First, it takes input 
N for the number of elements and X for the value 
to be searched. Then it reads N integers into an 
array. Using a loop, the program compares each 
element of the array with X. If a match is found,
 it sets a flag to true and stops checking further.
  At the end, if the value was found, it prints YES; 
  otherwise, it prints NO.
